# Homework Week 1: Accessibility Assignment

## Description
I have updaetd the Index.html file to improve the accessiblity of the Horiseon website. By adding semantic elements and alt descriptions for images this will improve the websites seo ranking and make the site more accessible for vision impaired users. I added headers, footers and sections so that the code is more readable and organised. I've been researching accessiblity requirements for websites and I have learnt a lot about how screen readers interpret html and why its important to have semantic elements.

* I added semantic elements to improve code assessibility

* I added alt text to all images so they can be picked up by screen readers

* I cleaned up and consolidated the CSS

## Installation

Here is the link to view the updated website page:
[Horiseon website link](https://adrian-szonyi.github.io/HomeworkWeek1-AdrianSzonyi/)

If you go to inspect the page you can see the changes to the html and css structure that have been made to make the page more accessible.

If a user were to use a screen reader extension the alt text added for images will be read out.
